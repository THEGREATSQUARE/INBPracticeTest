INB 300 Chapter 2 Study Guide

Purpose and Perspective of the Chapter

The purpose of this chapter is to explore the concept of institutions, popularly known as the “rules of the game.” As economic players, firms play by these rules. However, institutions are not static. They may change, resulting in institutional transitions — ” fundamental and comprehensive changes introduced to the formal and informal rules of the game that affect firms as players.” Firms must respond to these changes. 

Overall, the success and failure of a firm around the globe are, to a large extent, determined by its ability to understand and take advantage of the different rules of the game. In other words, how firms play the game and win (or lose), at least in part, depends on how the rules are made, enforced, and changed. This calls for firms to constantly monitor, decode, and adapt to the changing rules of the game in order to survive and prosper. As a result, such an institution-based view has emerged as a leading perspective on global business. This chapter first introduces this view. Then, it focuses on formal institutions (such as politics, laws, and economics). Informal institutions (such as cultures, ethics, and norms) will be discussed in Chapter 3.

UNDERSTANDING INSTITUTIONS (LO 2-1, PPT Slides 3–6)

Key Concepts

Institutions are commonly defined as “the rules of the game.” Institutions have formal and informal components, each with different supportive pillars.

Key Terms

Institutional transition: Fundamental and comprehensive changes introduced to the formal and informal rules of the game that affect firms as players

Institution-based view: A leading perspective in global business that suggests that the success and failure of firms are enabled and constrained by institutions

Institution: Formal and informal rules of the game

Institutional framework: Formal and informal institutions that govern individual and firm behavior

Formal institution: Institution represented by laws, regulations, and rules

Regulatory pillar: The coercive power of governments

Informal institution: Institution represented by cultures, ethics, and norms

Normative pillar: The mechanism through which norms influence individual and firm behavior

Norms: Values, beliefs, and actions of relevant players that influence the focal individuals and firms

Cognitive pillar: The internalized (or taken-for-granted) values and beliefs that guide individual and firm behavior

WHAT DO INSTITUTIONS DO? (LO 2-1, PPT Slides 7–8)

Key Concepts

The key function of institutions is to reduce uncertainty.

Key Terms

Transaction cost: The cost associated with economic transactions or, more broadly, the cost of doing business

Opportunism: The act of self-interest seeking with guile

Transition economy: Label for a subset of emerging economies, particularly those moving from central planning to market competition (such as China, Poland, Russia, and Vietnam)

AN INSTITUTION-BASED VIEW OF GLOBAL BUSINESS (LO 2-2, PPT Slides 9–12)

Key Concepts

Proposition 1: Managers and firms rationally pursue their interests and make choices within the formal and informal institutional constraints in a given institutional framework. 

Proposition 2: While formal and informal institutions combine to govern firm behavior, in situations where formal constraints are unclear or fail, informal constraints will play a larger role in reducing uncertainty and providing constancy to managers and firms.

Key Terms

Bounded rationality: The necessity of making rational decisions in the absence of complete information

Nonmarket (political) strategy: A strategy that centers on leveraging political and social relationships

Institutional work: Purposive action aimed at creating, maintaining, and disrupting institutions

POLITICAL SYSTEMS (LO 2-3, PPT Slides 13–15)

Key Concepts

Democracy is a political system in which citizens elect representatives to govern the country. 

Totalitarianism is a political system in which one person or party exercises absolute political control over the population.

Authoritarianism is a political system in which political plurality is undermined and concentrated government power is imposed.

While the degree of hostility toward business varies among different types of totalitarianism and authoritarianism (some are more probusiness than others), totalitarianism and authoritarianism in general are not as good for business as democracy.

As the forces of deglobalization march around the world, firms must be prepared to deal with geopolitical risk.

Key Terms

Political system: The rules of the game on how a country is governed politically

Democracy: A political system in which citizens elect representatives to govern the country on their behalf

Totalitarianism (dictatorship): A political system in which one person or party exercises absolute political control over the population
