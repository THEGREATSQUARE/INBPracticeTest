INB 300 Chapter 1 Study Guide

Purpose and Perspective of the Chapter

The purpose of this chapter is to explore the concepts of international and global business. First, we discuss the importance of studying global business. Then, we develop the unified framework used in each chapter, which focuses learning on one fundamental question and two core perspectives—an institution-based view and a resource-based view. Next, we explore the concepts of globalization, semiglobalization, and risk management. As a backdrop for the remainder of the text, the Global Business and Globalization at a Crossroads section makes two points: First, a basic understanding of the global economy is necessary. Second, it is important to critically examine your own personal views and biases regarding globalization. Additionally, we outline three leading debates concerning business and globalization/deglobalization. Finally, we explore the broad implications for savvy managers and students for the future of global business in a less global world.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND GLOBAL BUSINESS (LO 1-1, PPT Slides 3–4)

Key Concepts

International business is typically defined as (1) a business (firm) that engages in international (cross-border) economic activities and (2) the action of doing business abroad. 

Global business is defined in this book as business around the globe and includes both (1) international (cross-border) business activities covered by traditional IB books and (2) domestic business activities. 

This book goes beyond competition in developed economies. It devotes extensive space to competitive battles waged in emerging economies and the base of the global economic pyramid.

A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK (LO 1-3, PPT Slides 10–12)

Key Concepts

Our most fundamental question is: What determines the success and failure of firms around the globe? The two core perspectives are (1) the institution-based view and (2) the resource-based view. We develop a unified framework by organizing materials in every chapter according to the two perspectives guided by the fundamental question.

GLOBALIZATION AND SEMIGLOBALIZATION (LO 1-4, PPT Slides 13–19)

Key Concepts

Advocates of globalization count its contributions to include greater economic growth, higher standards of living, improved technology, and more extensive cultural exchange. 

Critics argue that globalization destroys jobs in rich countries, exploits workers in poor countries, grants MNEs too much power, degrades the environment, and promotes inequality. 

This section (1) outlines three views on globalization, (2) reviews the swing of the pendulum, (3) highlights the importance of risk management, and (4) discusses the important idea of semiglobalization.
